# BACKLOG — what the mega-refactor found and did not do {#root}

_Created 2026-07-26 by owner directive. **Findings raised during the PROP-043
Progress-Control programme that are neither the campaign's own work nor an
emergency collect here, and the next wave of work drains from this file.**_

**Not `TASKS.md`.** That file is a live checklist for one work-slice — items
that are commits waiting to be made. This one is the opposite genre: findings
nobody is working on yet, kept so the decision to work on them can be taken
deliberately later. Two different questions, two files, by owner ruling.

---

## What this file is, against the three that resemble it {#boundaries}

| file | holds | drained by |
|---|---|---|
| ##REL-TASKS `TASKS.md` | the current slice's checklist — each item is a commit | itself, as work lands |
| ##REL-DEFERRALS `campaigns/<id>/deferrals.md` | **one campaign's** tails; dies with the zone | the next campaign's mandate (`campaign-plans` law) |
| ##REL-AUDIT `AUDIT.md` | the periodic health sweep; an append-only **trend** | re-judged at the next audit |
| ##REL-BACKLOG **this file** | product-shaped findings the programme surfaced and deliberately did not act on | the next wave of work, after the programme reaches its end |

- ##TASKS2-OUTLIVES-THE-ZONE **It lives at the repository root because a campaign zone is
  disposable.** `ZONE-LIFETIMES` says `run/` is throwaway after close-out and
  wave 1's already is. A finding about where the product should go outlives the
  campaign that noticed it.
- ##TASKS2-GENRE **Genre: forward-looking, non-binding, drained by a later mandate.** Not
  a contract, not a checkpoint, not a health record. `spec-genres`' map does not
  carry this genre — the row is owed, alongside the documentation row Phase G
  adds.

## The three severities {#severity}

The scale is **P1 / P2 / P3**, taken from the `health-audit` flow rather than
invented. One severity vocabulary in the project, not two.

| | meaning | routing |
|---|---|---|
| ##SEV-P1 **P1** | security, data loss, structural integrity — **or a gate reporting green while not looking** | **stops the wave, reaches the owner the same session.** It never enters this file as a plan; it appears only afterwards, as record |
| ##SEV-P2 **P2** | a real gap with no emergency in it: a missing surface, a feature the corpus assumes and the code lacks, a mechanism specified and unbuilt | **this file.** Drains into the next wave |
| ##SEV-P3 **P3** | noted, no action planned | recorded here as `accepted`, so it is not rediscovered as new |

- ##SEV-ASSIGNED-BY-REVIEWER **Severity is the reviewer's call, never a worker's.** A cheap model
  calling something critical is noise, and a scale anyone may set is not a
  scale. A worker **reports the observation**; the reviewer classifies it.
- ##SEV-WORKER-MAY-INTERRUPT **One exception, running the other way:** a worker that believes it has
  found something genuinely alarming — a credential in source, an auth bypass, a
  gate that is lying — **stops its own packet and says so immediately**. The
  classification stays the reviewer's; the *interruption* needs no permission.
- ##SEV-P1-IS-NEVER-FILED **A P1 is never «filed».** That is the whole point of the split: one
  class of finding is not allowed to become a line in a list. If it is here, it
  is here as history, with what was done.
- ##SEV-GATE-BLINDNESS-IS-P1 **A gate that reports green because it is not looking is P1**, not P2.
  This programme found that shape three times — a floor gating a frozen slot, a
  parser blind to units the grammar allows, a sync check covering four of seven
  workspaces. Each was green and each was wrong, and a green panel that says
  nothing about coverage is a structural-integrity failure, not a gap.

## What an entry carries {#entries}

An **id**, the **`spec://…#ANCHOR`** it came from where one exists, a one-line
**locator**, a **severity**, a **disposition** (`open` · `planned` · `done` ·
`accepted`), and the **campaign or session** that filed it.

- ##ENTRY-CITES-NEVER-RESTATES **Cite the anchor; never restate the fact.** The same law Phase G's
  documentation runs on, for the same reason: a restated fact is a second
  statement of one truth with its own writer, and this programme has found that
  shape seven times.
- ##ENTRY-PREFER-GENERATED **Prefer generated over hand-maintained.** Where a finding is already
  carried by a marker — `action="rework"`, `stage="idea"`, an `#[ignore]`d test
  bound by its `verifies` edge — **the marked corpus is the source and this file
  quotes a query, not a copy.** A hand-maintained backlog is a derived value
  with its own writer, which is the defect class this programme keeps paying for.
- ##ENTRY-NO-SILENT-DELETION An entry leaves only by changing disposition, never by deletion. A
  backlog that forgets is indistinguishable from one that was never right.

## P1 — handled; kept as record {#p1}

*(empty — an open P1 is not in a file, it is in the owner's hands)*

## P2 — the next wave drains from here {#p2}

*(empty — Phase T's **T-unbuilt** bucket is expected to be the first filler: a
fact whose surface does not exist is a P2 by construction, and the ignored test
already written from it is the specification of the work)*

## P3 — accepted, no action planned {#p3}

*(empty)*
