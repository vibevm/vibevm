//! The reusable view-component library (PROP-037 §2 "The component library").
//!
//! This is the abstraction that stops "a million implementations of the same
//! control" from accumulating: every modal, menu, and dialog in the TUI composes
//! these components, and a restyle touches only [`super::theme`]. The component
//! strategy (PROP-037 §2.1 — wrap, extend, invent) is applied per component:
//!
//! - [`Window`] — the bordered, titled, centered panel (§2.3). Extracted from
//!   the three call sites (`modal`, `menu`, `search`) that each inlined the same
//!   centered-popup pattern. Composes `theme::panel()`/`border()`/`title()`.
//! - [`Card`] — a `Window` laid out as a labelled vertical form (§2.9 `#card`,
//!   §8 `#detail-card`): bold field headers, wrapped values, blank-line
//!   spacing, and the theme `✕` close glyph. The detail modal renders through
//!   it instead of a glued text blob.
//! - [`Group`] — a bordered frame clustering children, with an optional name at
//!   the frame's top-right (§2.6). Wraps `Block` (stateless frame, no focus
//!   graph). The F2 sort/shape menu frames its groups with this.
//! - [`Button`] — the labelled, focusable control (§2.5). Invented on
//!   `ratatui_core`; see `button`'s module doc for the wrap-vs-invent reasoning.
//! - [`RadioGroup`] — mutually-exclusive options, exactly one selected (§2.7).
//!   Invented on `ratatui_core` (rat-widget's selection widgets are stateful);
//!   the selected option carries the theme on-glyph, the rest the off-glyph.
//! - [`TextField`] — a single-line editable text input (§2.8). Invented minimal
//!   on `ratatui_core` (rat-widget's edit widget is stateful); `type_char`/
//!   `backspace` + a `█` cursor when focused.
//! - [`MsgDialog`] — a `Window` + body + `OK` button (§2.10). The shared base
//!   for the [`ComingSoon`] placeholder modal and the quit-confirm dialog.
//! - [`ComingSoon`] — the standard placeholder for every not-yet-built feature
//!   (§2.10): a `MsgDialog` titled with the feature name and the fixed body
//!   "This feature is not built yet." PNG export (§10.4) is the first user.
//!
//! Call sites never reach past this module to `rat_widget::`/`ratatui_widgets::`
//! for the window/group pattern (PROP-037 §2.1) — they talk to [`Window`] /
//! [`Group`] instead.

// quit-confirm, P7 ComingSoon/PNG, and the later copy-settings §10.2 / file-path
// §10.5 modals). `Window`, `Group`, and `Card` are live today. Matches the
