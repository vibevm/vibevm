# vibevm — architecture

A contributor-facing tour of the workspace. For the canonical specification, read [`VIBEVM-SPEC.md`](../VIBEVM-SPEC.md); for the design decisions on each subsystem, read the PROP documents under [`spec/common/`](../spec/common/) and [`spec/modules/`](../spec/modules/). This document is the connective tissue: how the crates fit together, what the key traits are, and where each pipeline walks.

## The mental model

Three concepts together describe almost everything vibevm does:

1. **Package** — a `(kind, name, version)` triple plus a content tree. Identity is `(kind, name, version, content_hash)` ([PROP-002 §2.1](../spec/modules/vibe-registry/PROP-002-decentralized-registry.md#identity)). Four kinds: `flow`, `feat`, `stack`, `tool`. Authoring is documented per kind in [`authoring-{flow,feat,stack}.md`](README.md).

2. **Registry** — a hosting organization URL with one git repo per package underneath. `vibe.toml`'s `[[registry]]` array lists registries in priority order; `[[mirror]]` adds transparent fallbacks; `[[override]]` short-circuits the registry layer for specific packages. Detailed in [PROP-002](../spec/modules/vibe-registry/PROP-002-decentralized-registry.md).

3. **Pipeline** — every CLI command is one of a few well-defined stages. `install` is the load-bearing one: **resolve → fetch → plan → confirm → apply → register**. `publish` is its mirror image on the maintainer side: **read → check-or-create-repo → stage → push → tag**.

Everything below is plumbing connecting these three concepts.

## Workspace crates

| Crate | What lives here | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vibe-core` | Manifest schemas (one `vibe.toml` per node, parsed into `PackageManifest` / `ProjectManifest` / workspace shapes, plus `Lockfile`), package identity (`PackageRef`, `CapabilityRef`, `VersionSpec`, `PackageKind`), error types. The shared vocabulary every other crate speaks. | (no internal deps) |
| `vibe-graph` | Task-graph builder and sequential runner. Drives the `install` and (eventually M1.5) `build` workflows. | `vibe-core` |
| `vibe-registry` | Git operations behind the `GitBackend` trait (`ShellGit` impl). `LocalRegistry`, `GitRegistry` (legacy monorepo, retired), `GitPackageRegistry` (per-package, current), `MultiRegistryResolver`. The `Registry` trait + `CachedPackage` value type. | `vibe-core` |
| `vibe-resolver` | `DepProvider` / `DepSolver` traits. `NaiveDepSolver` (DFS, no backtracking) is today's impl; resolvo / libsolv slots reserved. `MultiRegistryProvider` and `LocalRegistryProvider` adapt the registry layer for the solver. | `vibe-core`, `vibe-registry` |
| `vibe-install` | `plan_install` / `apply_install` / `register_installed` / `unregister_installed`. The content_hash integrity check. Under the loading model ([PROP-009](../spec/modules/vibe-workspace/PROP-009-loading-model.md)) materialisation and boot-artifact generation move into `vibe-workspace`; the boot-snippet-prefix collision check is retired (the `NN-` prefix no longer exists). | `vibe-core`, `vibe-registry` |
| `vibe-workspace` | Workspace discovery (`Workspace::discover`), the unified-resolution finalize pass, the computed-view engine. Materialises resolved packages into the `vibedeps/` tree and generates the per-node boot artifacts (`INLINE.md` / `INDEX.md`) and the managed `<vibevm>` redirect block ([PROP-009](../spec/modules/vibe-workspace/PROP-009-loading-model.md), [PROP-012](../spec/modules/vibe-workspace/PROP-012-managed-redirect-block.md)). | `vibe-core`, `vibe-registry` |
| `vibe-publish` | `RepoCreator` trait + `GitVerseCreator` impl. `Publisher` orchestrator. `Token` (with debug/display redaction). Inline `git_publish` module for staging / push / tag. | `vibe-core`, `vibe-registry` |
| `vibe-llm` | LLM provider abstraction. Stubs today; M1.5 lights it up with Anthropic / OpenAI / OpenRouter / Ollama adapters. | `vibe-core` |
| `vibe-check` | Spec linter (`vibe check`). Stubs today; M1.3 implements the full §12 check list. | `vibe-core` |
| `vibe-wire` | JTD-codegen'd wire types. Empty placeholder until `jtd-codegen` is installed and `cargo xtask codegen` populates `src/generated/`. | `serde`, `serde_json` |
| `vibe-cli` | The `vibe` binary. clap argument parsing, command dispatch, output formatting, `InstallResolver` enum bridging `LocalRegistry` and `MultiRegistryResolver` paths. | almost everything |
| `xtask` | `cargo xtask codegen` / `check-codegen`. Dev-only; excluded from `default-members`. | `clap`, `anyhow` |

Dependency direction is strictly downward — no cycles. A change in `vibe-core` rebuilds the whole tree; a change in `vibe-cli` rebuilds only the CLI.

## Key traits

These are the abstraction seams. Each one was introduced so a future implementation can replace the current one without touching consumers — see [PROP-001 §2.2](../spec/modules/vibe-registry/PROP-001-git-backend.md#backend-trait) for the design pattern.

### `GitBackend` ([`vibe-registry::git_backend`](../crates/vibe-registry/src/git_backend))

Every git operation goes through this trait. Two implementations:

- **`ShellGit`** (current) — spawns the system `git` binary. Default-friendly on Windows because it picks up the user's existing SSH-agent identity and credential helper. Used in production.
- **`LibGit2` slot** — feature-gated for a future swap to `libgit2` if shell-out ever becomes the wrong choice. Not implemented today.

Methods:

- `bootstrap` / `update` — clone or fast-forward a repo.
- `list_tags` — `git ls-remote --tags`, deduped peeled-form. No clone.
- `fetch_file_at_ref` — `git archive` over the wire to read a single file from a tag without cloning. Used by `GitPackageRegistry::fetch_dep_manifest` so the resolver can read N candidate manifests with N HTTP round-trips, not N clones.

### `Registry` ([`vibe-registry`](../crates/vibe-registry/src/lib.rs))

`list_versions` / `resolve` / `fetch`. Three implementations:

- **`LocalRegistry`** — M0 local-directory layout (`<root>/<kind>/<name>/v<ver>/...`). Used by `--registry <path>` and the in-tree `fixtures/registry/` for hermetic e2e tests.
- **`GitRegistry`** (legacy) — clones one big monorepo, treats its working tree as a `LocalRegistry`. M1.1-shipping. Retired in favour of `GitPackageRegistry`.
- **`GitPackageRegistry`** (current) — one repo per package under an organization URL. Versions are git tags. Cache layout `<bucket>/packages/<kind>-<name>/clone/`.

### `MultiRegistryResolver` ([`vibe-registry::multi_registry_resolver`](../crates/vibe-registry/src/multi_registry_resolver.rs))

Sits on top of an ordered set of `GitPackageRegistry` instances and threads `[[mirror]]` and `[[override]]` resolution. `resolve(pkgref)` returns a `MultiResolution` with provenance (which registry served, source URL, source ref, override flag). `fetch(&MultiResolution)` materialises a `CachedPackage` with the full lockfile provenance fields filled. `refresh_lockfile_clones` drives `vibe registry sync`.

### `DepProvider` / `DepSolver` ([`vibe-resolver`](../crates/vibe-resolver/src/lib.rs))

`DepProvider` — what the solver needs from the registry layer (`resolve_version`, `fetch_manifest`). Implemented by `MultiRegistryProvider` (production) and `LocalRegistryProvider` (`--registry <path>` path). Test fakes implement it directly.

`DepSolver` — what the install pipeline calls (`solve(roots) -> ResolvedGraph`). `NaiveDepSolver` is today's impl; resolvo / libsolv slots reserved per [PROP-002 §2.8](../spec/modules/vibe-registry/PROP-002-decentralized-registry.md#solver).

### `RepoCreator` ([`vibe-publish`](../crates/vibe-publish/src/lib.rs))

Host-specific operations for the publish flow: `host_name`, `repo_exists`, `create_repo`. One impl per supported git host. Today: `GitVerseCreator` (Gitea-compatible REST API). GitHub / Gitea / Forgejo land as adopters request them, each as one new file in `vibe-publish`.

## Wire formats

| Format | Where |
| --- | --- |
| **TOML** for human-edited configs: [`vibe.toml`](../VIBEVM-SPEC.md) (the single manifest — `[project]` for a consumer, `[package]` for a publishable artifact, `[workspace]` for a coordinator) and [`vibe.lock`](../VIBEVM-SPEC.md). Schemas in `VIBEVM-SPEC.md` §7; serde-driven via `vibe-core::manifest`. |
| **JTD** for machine-to-machine wire contracts: every CLI `--json` output, every HTTP API request/response, future LLM provider wrappers, future telemetry. Schemas committed under [`schemas/`](../schemas/); generated Rust under `crates/vibe-wire/src/generated/` once `jtd-codegen` is installed. |

The split is deliberate per [PROP-000 §16](../spec/common/PROP-000.md#jtd) — TOML for humans, JTD for machines.

## Cache layout

Per-user, under `~/.vibe/registries/` (override via `VIBE_REGISTRY_CACHE`):

```
~/.vibe/registries/
└── <canonical-url-hash>/
    ├── meta.toml                              # canonical URL, last-mirror-used, last_synced_at
    └── packages/
        └── <kind>-<name>/
            ├── clone/                         # per-package git working tree
            └── meta.toml                      # source_url_last_used, last_synced_at, last_known_tags
```

Per-project, under `<project>/.vibe/cache/`:

```
<project>/.vibe/cache/
└── <kind>/
    └── <name>/
        └── v<version>/                        # materialised package contents (no .git)
            ├── vibe.toml
            └── …
```

The per-user cache is keyed on **canonical** registry URL — a `[[mirror]]` doesn't invalidate the cache, the project just gets to use a different mirror's bytes that hash to the same content_hash.

The per-project cache is the lockfile's mirror — every entry there has a corresponding `<kind>/<name>/v<version>/` payload. `vibe uninstall` does NOT purge per-project cache; reinstalling is one round trip cheaper that way.
